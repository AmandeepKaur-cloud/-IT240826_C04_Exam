# There are major 10 commomn mistakes in excel:

* 1. Merge & centre cells: The problem with merged and centred cells is they interfere when selecting a range of cells
* 2. Non-tablular layout: One of the BIGGEST mistakes I see is data in the wrong layout.
* 3. Dates Formatted as Text: Dates formatted as text, which usually come from files exported from external systems, can be tricky to detect because they look the same on the face of the cell and even in the formula bar
* 4. External Links: This is to point out that the following functions do not work when referencing closed external workbooks
* 5. Formatting Whole Columns/Rows: It’s quick and easy to apply formatting to the whole column or row, but this just adds unnecessary data to your file, making your file size bigger than it needs to be.
* 6. Formatting to Encode Data: It’s common practice to use cell fill colours to encode data. The problem with this is you can’t reference cell fill colour in formulas, which makes it difficult to count data that matches a fill colour.
* 7. Formatting Colours: Instead of bringing attention to the data, it makes your reader uncomfortable and the information difficult to read.
* 8.  Multiple Records in One Cell: It can be tempting to shove as much data in a single cell as possible, but it’s difficult to then analyse that data with formulas.
* 9. Sum Ranges Omitting Cells: Adding new rows of data above a SUM formula can sometimes result in the new row being omitted from the SUM.
* 10. Using .xls File Type: The .xls file type was replaced with .xlsx from Excel 2007 onward, however many third party systems still have an option to export data to .xls.
