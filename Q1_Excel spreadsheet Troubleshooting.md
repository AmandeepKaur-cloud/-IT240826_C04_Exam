# Introduction:
Sometimes, we get errors such as #N/A or #VALUE in Excel! Even though we have applied formulae correctly (at least for ourselves, we feel we have applied those correctly). These issues might be due to different reasons, such as using the same formula multiple times as a reference, getting dates in number format, getting #N/A, or #VALUE! Errors etc. In these cases, finding what is going wrong with the formula is difficult for the naked eye. However, if we follow some checkpoints for such errors, there are ample possibilities that we will be able to eliminate those. Excel Troubleshooting is the process of rectifying the errors from a formula and nullifying them. We will see some methods to troubleshoot the formula errors in Excel
